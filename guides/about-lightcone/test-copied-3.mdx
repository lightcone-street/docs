**how can i trust your information if it has only xyz volume**

> > "But the information is worthless if it has low volume!"\
> > A) not necessarily. if price is deemed fair by market participants, little volume will happen until the equilibrium is broken, at which point much more capital may be willing to "fix" what they deem an erronous mispricing.\
> > B) Mispricings are part of the reflexive cycle! If you see what you believe is a badly priced market, you're incentivized to go fix it! This in turn creates more volume, and more accurate information, which in turns mean more people are exposed to the information, which in turn they may view as mispriced, so on and so forth. If a clearly mispriced Lightcone market goes viral, we'd be thrilled, because that likely will be extremely effective in onbaording new market pacticipants to Lightcone, making the information more accurate going forward.

⟩⟩ **How will you grow liquidity?** 

Lightcone facilitates fundamentally novel price discovery. There's no easy way to market-make while staying comfortably delta-neutral amongst several venues, as is the case with the 114th perps exchange competitor. This means we have to take the long, hard road of cultivating a healthy ecosystem of profitable market-makers. In the early days, people like you can come in, develop new methods of analysis or risk management that are specific to impact markets, and capture spread from traders. We believe an early start will prove worthwhile, and is currently the best way to benefit from Lightcone's growth as an outsider. Contact us if this sounds appealing to you.

With that said; there are multiple reasons why impact markets are vastly more tractable and forgiving to market-make than prediction markets, read more in our original reply to the question
