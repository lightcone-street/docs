⟩⟩ **Can impact information be trusted when trading volumes are low? **

Firstly, note that low volumes do not guarantee a mispricing; it's correlational rather than causal relationship. At times, volume can be low precisely _because _market participants largely agree it sits at a fair price point. In those cases, little trading happens until the equilibrium is broken for one of many possible reasons. 

Secondly, when mispricings do exist, they're a crticial part of a positive reflexive cycle!

When users see what they believe is a mispriced asset, are incentivized to take advantage of it! This in turn increases the market's activity, which in turn increases the accuracy of the information, which in turn makes Lightcone's information a more valuable and shareable public good, which in turn brings in more eyes on potentially mispriced markets, and so on and so forth.

Easy-to-recoginze mispricings are great because they mean the markets have not graudated yet to the point where alpha only gets extracted by large sophisitcated players. If a clearly mispriced Lightcone market goes viral, we'd be thrilled, as it'll likely will be extremely effective in onboarding new market pacticipants looking to turn a profit for themselves; making the Lightcone's information more accurate going forward, and the product better.

⟩⟩ **How will you grow liquidity?**

Lightcone facilitates fundamentally novel price discovery. There's no easy way to market-make while staying comfortably delta-neutral amongst several venues, as is the case with the 114th perps exchange competitor. This means we have to take the long, hard road of cultivating a healthy ecosystem of profitable market-makers. In the early days, people like you can come in, develop new methods of analysis or risk management that are specific to impact markets, and capture spread from traders. We believe an early start will prove worthwhile, and is currently the best way to benefit from Lightcone's growth as an outsider. Contact us if this sounds appealing to you.

With that said; there are multiple reasons why impact markets are vastly more tractable and forgiving to market-make than prediction markets, read more in our original reply to the question
