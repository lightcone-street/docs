Markets are the best truth-seeking system known to man. We believe this to be self evident<sup>1</sup>. Lightcone employs markets, as the powerful global hivemind that they are, to expose **_the future consequences of any event_**, before, or whether at all, it actually happens.

Such information is often equally important if not more important to know than an event's probability. It explicitly:

1. Informs **politicians** on the impact of **war**
2. Informs **lawmakers** on the impact of their **legislature**
3. Informs **central banks** on the impact of possible **monetary policy**
4. Informs **boards and executives** on the impact of **corporate decisions**
5. Informs **voters** on the impact of upcoming **elections**
6. Informs **investors** on questions like **_"what's the next catalyst?"_** or **_"is it priced in?"_**

Meaning; the market, a.k.a participants incentivized by search of profit, produced private market research that was able to anticipate weather better than the NWS. This was in 1984! Back then, financial markets were much smaller and drastically less accessible than they are today.
