Global markets are the most powerful truth-seeking system known to man. We believe this to be self evident.

<Accordion title="Show me evidence anyway">
  For those who still question it, here's a fun exhibit - in the 1980s, Richard Roll proved it’s possible to [<u>predict Orlando’s weather better than the National Weather Service by observing the price movements of Orange Juice futures</u>](https://authors.library.caltech.edu/records/2de2j-w4z25). Meaning; the market, when incentivized with financial returns, produced private market research which was able to anticipate weather better than the NWS. This was back in 1984! Back then, financial markets were much smaller and drastically less accessible than they are today.

Lightcone provides an answer for **_what are the consequences of this event?_** this information is often equally important to know, and at times much more so, than its probability.

prediction markets build probabalistic answers. lightcone builds determinstic answers. in some way, more of a truth machine, more of an oracle, a look into the future.

1. Informs **politicians** on the impact of **war**
2. informs **lawmakers** on the impact of their **legislature**
3. informs **central banks** on the impact of possible **monetary policy**
4. informs**boards and executives**  on the impact of**corporate decisions**
5. informs **voters **on the impact of upcoming**elections** 
6. informs **traders** on questions like _"what's the next _**_catalyst_**_?"_ or _"is it _**_priced in_**_?"_

\>\>"But the information is worthless if it has low volume!"\
A) not necessarily. if price is deemed fair by market participants, little volume will happen until the equilibrium is broken, at which point much more capital may be willing to "fix" what they deem an erronous mispricing.\
B) Mispricings are part of the reflexive cycle! If you see what you believe is a badly priced market, you're incentivized to go fix it! This in turn creates more volume, and more accurate information, which in turns mean more people are exposed to the information, which in turn they may view as mispriced, so on and so forth. If a clearly mispriced Lightcone market goes viral, we'd be thrilled, because that likely will be extremely effective in onbaording new market pacticipants to Lightcone, making the information more accurate going forward.
