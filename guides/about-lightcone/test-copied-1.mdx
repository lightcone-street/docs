The hivemind of global markets, when incentivized, is the most powerful truth exposing system known to man since the beginning of time.

informrs blah blah on blah blah

\>\>"But the information is worthless if it has low volume!"\
A) not necessarily. if price is deemed fair by market participants, little volume will happen until the equilibrium is broken, at which point much more capital may be willing to "fix" what they deem an erronous mispricing.\
B) Mispricings are part of the reflexive cycle! If you see what you believe is a badly priced market, you're incentivized to go fix it! This in turn creates more volume, and more accurate information, which in turns mean more people are exposed to the information, which in turn they may view as mispriced, so on and so forth. If a clearly mispriced Lightcone market goes viral, we'd be thrilled, because that likely will be extremely effective in onbaording new market pacticipants to Lightcone, making the information more accurate going forward.
