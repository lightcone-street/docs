**Lightcone** is an **Impact Markets** platform; a novel category of financial markets.

Lightcone lets users trade the **impact** of events on **financial assets**. Unlike prediction markets which let users trade on the probability of events, lightcone strips away the need to think about probability at all. Instead, traders need only think about an event's impact on the world.

In other words; it unlocks the _trading of financial assets assuming a certain event outcome is guaranteed to happen._

**What this means**

- A novel form of speculation - users may trade assets inside hypothetical universes that may or may not materialize _(if they don't, their full capital is returned)._
- A new type of free public information about the future impact of world events.

**For example**

Lightcone's 2026 US Midterms market would create two new assets to **trade**:

  <Note icon="r" color="#DC9BF2">
    BTC in the universe where Republicans win the 2026 elections
  </Note>
  <Note icon="d" color="#45ACF8">
    BTC in the universe where Democrats win the 2026 elections
  </Note>
</Columns>

The trading of these assets, in-turn, exposes its **impact information**:

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Note icon="r" color="#DC9BF2">
    BTC price IF Republicans win: \$??,???
  </Note>
  <Note icon="d" color="#45ACF8">
    BTC price IF Democrats win: \$??,???
  </Note>
</Columns>

Lightcone practically extends Bitcoin into two new versions of itself, `RWin-BTC` and `DWin-BTC` both of which trade separately. One of them will eventually become real spot Bitcoin.
