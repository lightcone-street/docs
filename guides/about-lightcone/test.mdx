**Lightcone** is an **Impact Markets** platform; a term we coined ourselves for this new category of information markets.

**Lightcone** lets users trade the **impact** of events on **real assets**. Unlike prediction markets which let users trade the probability of events, **Lightcone** strips away the need to think about probability. Instead, users need only think about a future event's impact.

In other words; _trade financial assets assuming X event is guaranteed to happen._

**Lightcone unlocks**

- A novel form of speculation - users can trade assets inside hypothetical universes that may or may not materialize _(if they don't, their full capital is returned)._
- A new type of mass-consumable information about the future impact of events on the world.

**For example**

```md
> Trade $BTC in the universe where REPUBLICANS win the 2026 elections
> Trade $BTC in the universe where DEMOCRATS win the 2026 elections
```

Which exposes the following information

```md
> $BTC price impact IF REPUBLICANS win the midterm elections
> $BTC price impact IF DEMOCRATS win the midterm elections
```
