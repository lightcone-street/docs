## Endpoint

https://tapi.lightcone.xyz/api

## Protocol

Lightcone's CLOB is hybrid-decentralized orderbook; Operators match orders offchain, while asset issuance, settlement and signature verification are executed onchain, non-custodially and trustlessly. Orders are ED25519-signed payloads.

The protocol specifies, for each market, the **_Deposit Tokens_** that available for trading _(e.g. USDC, wBTC, wETH)._

Deposit Tokens are held as collateral, against which a set of SPL **_Conditional Tokens_** are minted, one per possible outcome, _(e.g. USDC => [A-USDC, B-USDC])_, via what is called a **_split_**.

In the opposite direction - a full set of Conditional Tokens can **_merge_** to claim the underlying Deposit Tokens _(e.g. [A-USDC, B-USDC] => USDC)_

The protocol uses a custom Solana program facilitating swaps between _**Conditional Token pairs** (e.g. A-USDC/A-BTC)._ An _**Orderbook**_ always pairs Conditional Tokens of the **_same Universe/Condition_** against each other (_e.g. A against A, B against B)._

After a market **_settles_**, Conditional Tokens belonging to one Universe become **_redeemable 1:1_** for their corresponding Deposit Tokens _(e.g. if A Universe won; A-USDC, A-BTC redeem for USDC, BTC respectively)_, while the Conditional Tokens of all other Universes become effectively worthless.

## Error Codes

Error responses include a code field for programmatic handling:

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| INVALID_PUBKEY | Public key is malformed or wrong length |
| INVALID_SIGNATURE | Signature verification failed |
| SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE | Exchange engine is unreachable |
| NOT_FOUND | Requested resource does not exist |
| INVALID_ARGUMENT | Request parameter is invalid |
