<Note>
**This endpoint requires JWT authentication:**

1. Sign an authentication message using your Solana account
2. Receive a JWT, returned as an `auth_token` HttpOnly cookie

The JWT is valid for 14 days. Subsequent requests are authenticated via the cookie; an `Authorization` header is not required.

The user is identified from the JWT - no request body is needed.

## Pagination

This endpoint supports cursor-based pagination:

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `cursor` | string | - | Order hash from previous page's `next_cursor` |
| `limit` | integer | 200 | Max orders to return (max 1000) |

The response includes `next_cursor` (order hash for next page) and `has_more` (boolean).
