## Amount scaling (lamports only)

Order amounts specified in `maker_amount`, `taker_amount` **must be denominated in lamports** — the smallest unit of the token — **not** in human-readable units.

### How to determine the correct scaling

Every `conditional_tokens` object includes a `decimals` field.  

**Examples:**

- A conditional token with `decimals = 6`
  - `1.25` tokens → `(1.25 × 10^6)` → `1_250_000 lamports`

- A conditional token with `decimals = 8`
  - `0.01` tokens → `(0.01 × 10^8)` → `1_000_000 lamports`

These are not arbitrary; Conditional tokens always inherit the `decimals` of their underlying deposit asset.  


⚠️ Submitting unscaled (human-readable) amounts will result in **incorrect pricing or rejected orders**.
