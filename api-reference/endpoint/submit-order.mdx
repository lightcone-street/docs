<Note>

#### Amount scaling _(lamports only)_

Order amounts specified in `amount_in`, `amount_out` must be denominated in lamports, the smallest unit of the token.

Every `conditional_tokens` object includes a `decimals` field, which informs about the correct scaling to use for this specific conditional token.

**Examples**

- A conditional token with `decimals = 6`
  - `1.25` tokens → `(1.25 × 10^6)` → `1_250_000 lamports`

- A conditional token with `decimals = 8`
  - `0.01` tokens → `(0.01 × 10^8)` → `1_000_000 lamports`

These are not arbitrary; Conditional tokens always inherit the `decimals` of their underlying deposit asset.  

<Warning>

Submitting unscaled _(human-readable)_ amounts will result in incorrect pricing or rejected orders.
