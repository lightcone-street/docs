**Lightcone** is an **Impact Markets** platform; a novel extension of financial markets, built to let users directly trade the **financial impact** of world events.

On Lightcone, users don't need to think about whether an event occurs or its odds of happening. Instead, the only thing that matters is the event's consequences **_if_** it happens.

In other words it unlocks _trading assets while assuming a certain event outcome is guaranteed to happen_.

**what this means**

- A **novel vehicle** of speculation - trade assets inside hypothetical universes that may or may not materialize _(if they don't, the user's full capital is returned)._
- A **new type of** free public **information** about the future impact of world events, which in itself can _(and will)_ bend reality.


**example**



The Lightcone _2026 US House Elections_ market spawns two assets to trade:

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Callout icon="r" color="#DC9BF2">
    **BTC** in the universe where **Republicans win** the 2026 House elections
  </Callout>
  <Callout icon="d" color="#45ACF8">
    **BTC** in the universe where **Democrats win** the 2026 House elections
  </Callout>
</Columns>

The trading of these assets, in-turn, exposes their downstream **impact**:

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Callout icon="r" color="#DC9BF2">
    **BTC** price **_if_** Republicans win: \$??,???
  </Callout>
  <Callout icon="d" color="#45ACF8">
    **BTC** price **_if_** Democrats win: \$??,???
  </Callout>
</Columns>

**why**

Lightcone's primitive creates an entirely new design space for portfolio management and trading strategies, in addition to publicly exposing extremely valuable information using the hivemind of public markets.
