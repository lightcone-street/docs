**Lightcone** is an **Impact Markets** platform; a novel extension of financial markets, built to let users directly trade the **impact** of events on **financial assets**.

Unlike prediction markets which let users trade on the probability of events, on Lightcone, traders need only think about an event's impact on the world, while disregarding of its probability.

By unlocking the _trading of financial assets assuming a certain event outcome is guaranteed to happen_, your favorite assets can exist in a world of more perfect information.

**What this means**

- A novel form of speculation - trade assets inside hypothetical universes that may or may not materialize _(if they don't, the user's full capital is returned)._
- A new type of free public information about the future impact of world events, which in itself can _(and will)_ influence the world.

**For example**



The Lightcone _2026 US House Elections_ market spawns two assets to trade: <Badge size ="sm" className="badge-r">**RWin-BTC**</Badge> and <Badge size ="sm" className="badge-d">**DWin-BTC**</Badge>

    **BTC** in the universe where **Republicans win** the 2026 House elections
  </Callout>
  <Callout icon="d" color="#45ACF8">
    **BTC** in the universe where **Democrats win** the 2026 House elections
  </Callout>
</Columns>

The trading of these assets, in-turn, exposes the **impact information**:

  <Callout icon="r" color="#DC9BF2">
    **BTC** price **_if_** Republicans win: \$??,???
  </Callout>
  <Callout icon="d" color="#45ACF8">
    **BTC** price **_if_** Democrats win: \$??,???
  </Callout>
</Columns>

Lightcone practically extends Bitcoin into two new wrapper versions of itself, <Badge size ="sm" className="badge-r">**RWin-BTC**</Badge> and <Badge size ="sm" className="badge-d">**DWin-BTC**</Badge>, both of which trade simultaneously but separately. After the elections, one of them will redeem 1:1 to spot <Badge size="sm">**BTC**</Badge>.
