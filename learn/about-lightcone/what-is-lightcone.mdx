Lightcone is an _impact markets_ platform - it extends established financial markets, as a plugin of sorts, to let users directly trade, and foresee, the **financial impact of world events**.

On lightcone, users don't need to concern themselves by _whether_ an event occurs, nor its probability. Instead, they need only think about the consequences **_if_** it happens. In other words, lightcone unlocks _trading assets while assuming a certain event outcome is guaranteed to happen_.

**what this means**

- A **novel vehicle** of speculation - trade assets inside hypothetical universes that may or may not materialize _(if they don't, the user's full capital is returned)._
- A **new type of information**, free, public, about the future impact of world events, which itself can _(and will)_ bend reality.


**example**



The _"2026 US House Elections"_ lightcone market creates:

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Callout icon="r" color="#DC9BF2">
    **BTC** in the universe where **Republicans win** the 2026 House elections
  </Callout>
  <Callout icon="d" color="#45ACF8">
    **BTC** in the universe where **Democrats win** the 2026 House elections
  </Callout>
</Columns>

The trading of these assets, in-turn, exposes their downstream impact:

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Callout icon="r" color="#DC9BF2">
    **BTC** price **_if_** Republicans win: \$??,???
  </Callout>
  <Callout icon="d" color="#45ACF8">
    **BTC** price **_if_** Democrats win: \$??,???
  </Callout>
</Columns>

**why**

Lightcone creates an entirely new design space for portfolio management and trading strategies, in addition to publicly exposing extremely valuable information using the hivemind wisdom of public markets.
