Markets are the best truth-seeking system known to man. We believe this to be self evident<sup>1</sup>. Lightcone employs markets to expose **_the future consequences of any event_**, before, or whether at all, it actually happens. Market-based impact information will directly influence the decisions of key actors shaping the real world:

1. Informs **politicians** on the impact of **war**
2. Informs **lawmakers** on the impact of their **legislature**
3. Informs **central banks** on the impact of possible **monetary policy**
4. Informs **boards and executives** on the impact of **corporate decisions**
5. Informs **voters** on the impact of upcoming **elections**
6. Informs **investors** on questions like **_"what's the next catalyst?"_** or **_"is it priced in?"_**

The situation today is weird; anyone can look at Polymarket to see the probability of almost anything; a much better measure than the _"experts"_ previously relied on. And yet, to estimate the impact of those same events, one still has to rely on analysts, KOLs, media, and all manner of grifters.

But impact information is often equally important, if not more so, than probability. There is zero reason why it shouldn't enjoy the exact same treatment; sweeping aside the experts, the pundits, the scum and the wrong -- to instead produce market-based infromation that renders them all irrelevant.\
\
**Lightcone is a crystal ball for the impact of world events**, starting with their impact on financial assets. The vision is to **produce information that is impossible to ignore**<sup>2</sup>.

<sup>1 </sup> For those who still question the power of the incentivized hivemind (global markets), some fun anecdotal evidence; in the 1980s, Richard Roll proved it's possible to [<u>predict Orlando's weather better than the National Weather Service by observing the price movements of Orange Juice futures</u>](https://authors.library.caltech.edu/records/2de2j-w4z25). Meaning; the market, a.k.a participants incentivized by search of profit, produced private analysis that was able to anticipate weather better than the NWS. This was all the way back in 1984! Today's financial markets are much bigger in depth, scope and access.
