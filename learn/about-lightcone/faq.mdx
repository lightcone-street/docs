⟩⟩ **How does lightcone resolve markets? Is there an oracle?**

In-house; no external oracles are involved. If you want to understand why, read more here (_tldr; oracles are  approx useless for arbitrary data such as events' outcome resolution)_

⟩⟩ **Are lightcone prices predictive when volumes are low?**

Start by noting that low volumes do not guarantee a mispricing exists; the relation between accuracy and volume is one of correlation rather than causation. At times, volume can be low precisely _because_ the current price is fair. In those cases, little trading happens until the equilibrium is broken and contention get (re)introduced into the orderbooks, bringing volume with it.

Secondly, when mispricings do exist, they're a crticial part of a positive reflexive cycle.

When users identify what they believe is a mispriced asset, that's money on the grund and they're incentivized to take advantage of it! This, in-turn, increases the market's activity, which in-turn increases the accuracy of the information, which in-turn makes lightcone's information a more valuable and shareable source, which in-turn brings more eyes on potentially mispriced markets, and so on and so forth, ultimately making lightcone a better platform to both trade and consume.

Thirdly, we plan to empirically measure the platform's accuracy and publish the results on the <u>stats</u> dashboard.

⟩⟩ **How will you grow liquidity?**

Lightcone facilitates fundamentally novel price discovery, so there's no easy way to market-make while staying comfortably delta-neutral amongst several venues, as is the case with the 114th perps exchange competitor. This means we have to take the long hard road of cultivating a healthy ecosystem of profitable MMs. In the early days, people like you can come in, develop new methods of analysis and risk management that are specific to impact markets, and profit by capturing spread from traders. We believe an early start as a MM'er will prove worthwhile, and is currently the best way to bet on Lightcone's growth as an outsider. <u>Contact us</u> for white-glove onboarding.

With that said; there are multiple reasons why impact markets are vastly more tractable and forgiving to market-make than prediction markets. Read more our reply here:
