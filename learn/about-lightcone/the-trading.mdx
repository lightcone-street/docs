Lightcone extends financial markets to enable something that's never existed before: the ability to trade in hypothetical universes, each representing a deterministic reality in the context of a specific event.

The core premise is simple: **trade (\$XYZ) asset if (Outcome A) is a given.**

With that premise in mind, traders enter positions based on **impact** expectations alone, while disregarding the event's probability of occurrence.

**example /cont**

Circling back to our previous example:


<Columns cols={2}>
  <Callout icon="r" color="#DC9BF2">
    Buy or sell **BTC** in the universe where **Republicans win** the 2026 elections
  </Callout>
  <Callout icon="d" color="#45ACF8">
    Buy or sell **BTC** in the universe where **Democrats win** the 2026 elections
  </Callout>
</Columns>


**into the mechanism's belly**

Lightcone practically extends Bitcoin into two new wrapper versions of itself, <Badge size ="sm" className="badge-r">**RWin-BTC**</Badge> and <Badge size ="sm" className="badge-d">**DWin-BTC**</Badge>, both of which trade simultaneously but separately. After the elections, one of them will redeem 1:1 to spot <Badge size="sm">**BTC**</Badge>.

For every 1 BTC deposited into the market, two tokens are minted:

1. --> <Badge size ="sm" className="badge-r">**1 RWin-BTC**</Badge> _(token that converts to BTC only if Republicans win)_
2. --> <Badge size ="sm" className="badge-d">**1 DWin-BTC**</Badge> _(token that converts to BTC only if Democrats win)_

Similarly, for every 1 USDC deposited, two tokens are minted:

1. --> <Badge size ="sm" className="badge-r">**1 RWin-USDC**</Badge> _(token that converts to USDC only if Republicans win)_
2. --> <Badge size ="sm" className="badge-d">**1 DWin-USDC**</Badge> _(token that converts to USDC only if Democrats win)_

An _impact market_ is created by pairing two tokens of the **same universe** against each other in an orderbook:

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Callout icon="r" color="#DC9BF2">
    **Republicans win** orderbook:\
    \
    <Badge size ="sm" className="badge-r">**RWin-BTC / RWin-USDC**</Badge>
  </Callout>
  <Callout icon="d" color="#45ACF8">
    **Democrats win** orderbook:\
    \
    <Badge size ="sm" className="badge-d">**DWin-BTC / DWin-USDC**</Badge>
  </Callout>
</Columns>

Both pairs trade simultaneously at different exchange rates. Prices are ever-changing, but for the sake of example:

<Columns cols={3}>
  <Callout icon="r" color="#DC9BF2">
    <Badge size ="sm" className="badge-r">**RWin-BTC / RWin-USDC**</Badge>\
    \
    <Badge size ="xl" className="badge-r">**103,990**</Badge>

  </Callout>

  <Callout icon="d" color="#45ACF8">

    \
    <Badge size ="xl" className="badge-d">**87,882**</Badge>
  </Callout>
</Columns>


When the elections conclude, tokens in the winning universe will become redeemable 1:1 for real USDC and BTC, respectively.

Tokens in the losing universe will become irrelevant and worthless.

**picking a universe**

We must emphasize that on lightcone, users don't try to pick the winning universe as they do on prediction markets. The question _"What will happen?"_ doesn't really matter. The only relevant question is _"If this happens, what price should this asset trade at?"_

Effectively, users decide which universe they want to trade assets _**in**_, NOT which universe to bet _on._

It therefore might be confusing to use the terms _"winning"_ and _"losing"_ universes. We can more accurately refer to them as **_materliazing universe_** and a **_non-materializing universe_.**

You can see how **probability is removed from the trade**. You don't care about _whether_ the event happens, only about its impact _if_ it does.

**how probability is removed**

The key function to be aware of is the **_split_**.

On the UI, users just clicks Buy or Sell. But there is hidden step before an actual swap occurs - their asset first splits across the full set universes.

For example, a user wants to _**sell 0.55 BTC if the Democrats win**._

Let's walk through what actually happens:

  <Callout icon="btc" color="#fafafa">
    <Badge size ="sm" color="gray">**Deposit 0.55 Spot BTC** (Split) --> </Badge>
  </Callout>

<Columns cols={2}>

  <Callout icon="r" color="#DC9BF2">
    Balance: <Badge size ="m" className="badge-r">**0.55 RWin-BTC**</Badge>
  </Callout>

  <Callout icon="d" color="#45ACF8">
    Balance: <Badge size ="m" className="badge-d">**0.55 DWin-BTC**</Badge>
  </Callout>

</Columns>

This is fundamentally equal to holding 0.55 spot BTC, because it is guaranteed that at the end of the elections, one of the universe tokens will convert 1:1 to spot BTC. _(Note: because it's fundamentally equal, the protocol supports a reverse function called merge)_

In the next step, the protocol executes an actual swap:

  <Callout icon="d" color="#45ACF8">
    Swap: <Badge size ="m" className="badge-d">**0.55 DWin-BTC**</Badge> --> <Badge size ="m" className="badge-d">**48,335.1 DWin-USDC**</Badge>
  </Callout>

    Sold <Badge size ="sm" className="badge-d">**0.55 DWin-BTC**</Badge> at the price of 87,772. <Icon icon="refresh" size={10} /> Update balances:
<Columns cols={2}>
  <Callout icon="r" color="#DC9BF2">
    Balance: <Badge size ="m" className="badge-r">**0.55 RWin-BTC**</Badge>
  </Callout>

  <Callout icon="d" color="#45ACF8">
    Balance: <Badge size ="m" className="badge-d">**48,335.1 DWin-USDC**</Badge>
  </Callout>

</Columns>

So now the user has secured the selling price of 87,772. His trade will materialize if the democrats end up winning, after which he'll redeem `48,335.1 USDC`. If, however, the republicans end up winning, he'll redeem back `0.55 BTC`.

Of course, in the meantime, he can make more trades. Perhaps the market has repriced the democrats impact even further to the downside, down to a price of 83,602. At which point the user wants to buy back in that universe:

  <Callout icon="d" color="#45ACF8">
    Swap: <Badge size ="m" className="badge-d">**48,335.1 DWin-USDC**</Badge> --> <Badge size ="m" className="badge-d">**0.5782 DWin-BTC**</Badge>
  </Callout>

Behold his <Icon icon="refresh" size={10} /> updated exposure now:

<Columns cols={2}>

  <Callout icon="r" color="#DC9BF2">
    Balance: <Badge size ="m" className="badge-r">**0.55 RWin-BTC**</Badge>
  </Callout>

  <Callout icon="d" color="#45ACF8">
    Balance: <Badge size ="m" className="badge-d">**0.5782 DWin-BTC**</Badge>
  </Callout>

</Columns>

This example should give you a feel as to what's possible. Ultimately, lightcone is greenfield primitive for speculation and portfolio management, and we expect it to be used in increasingly interesting and unexpected ways over time _(yes, most obvious of which is hedging, as people love to point out - but think bigger)._
