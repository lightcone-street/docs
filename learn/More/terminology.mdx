## Core Concepts

#### Markets

A market represents a distinct event with multiple possible outcomes.

e.g.
"US 2028 Presidential Elections" with outcomes Republican Win, Democrat Win.

#### Universe Tokens (todo)

Universe tokens (sometimes referred to as _conditional tokens_), are SPL tokens on Solana issued by the lightcone protocol for market deposits. Each possible outcome in a market (event) has corresponding universe tokens, normally `universe-USDC` and at least one other arbitrary `universe-asset` to trade.

Universe tokens are essentially promissory notes to the underlying spot assets, but which only materialize if their corresponding universe materializes.

A market with 3 outcomes, will issue 3 universe tokens for each underlying deposit asset.

e.g. "March Fed Meeting Rate Change" market would have 3 different universes, and thus the following   universe tokens: `0cut-USDC`, `0cut-BTC`, `25cut-USDC`, `25cut-BTC`, `>50cut-USDC`, `>50cut-BTC`



#### Market Settlement

Settlement references to the point in time after a market's outcome has become known, when lightcone pushes an onchain oracle update to signal it to the protocol.

Post-settlement, users can redeem winning universe tokens 1:1 for corresponding spot assets, without a deadline.

e.g. in the "US 2024 Presidential Elections" market, after settlement all `TrumpWin` universe tokens (`TrumpWin-USDC`, `TrumpWin-BTC`, `TrumpWin-SOL`, etc) would have become redeemable for spot, while all KamalaWin tokens would be worthless (as in; can never become redeemable for spot).
