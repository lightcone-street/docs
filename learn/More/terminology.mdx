## Core Concepts

### Markets

A market represents a question with multiple possible outcomes (e.g.,
"US 2028 Presidential Elections" with outcomes A, B, C).

on-chain SPL token that is redeemable for the deposit asset if that
outcome wins. For a market with 3 outcomes, there are 3 conditional tokens.
