## Core Concepts

### ❬ Markets ❭

A market is a distinct world event with multiple possible outcomes.

e.g.
_"US 2028 Presidential Elections"_ market, with the outcomes _"Republican Win"_, _"Democrat Win"_.

### ❬ Outcome Tokens ❭

Outcome tokens (sometimes referred to as _universe tokens or conditional tokens_), are unique SPL tokens on Solana issued by the lightcone protocol for trading in each specific market.

Outcome tokens are essentially promissory notes to the underlying spot assets, which only materialize _if_ their corresponding outcome materializes.

e.g., a _"March Fed Meeting Rate Change"_ may have 3 different outcomes: <br />
<Badge size ="sm" className="badge-r">**0cut**</Badge>  <Badge size ="sm" className="badge-d">**25cut**</Badge>   <Badge size ="sm" className="badge-i">**>50cut**</Badge>

And the following Outcome Tokens: <br />
<Badge size ="sm" className="badge-r">**0cut-USDC**</Badge> <Badge size ="sm" className="badge-r">**0cut-BTC**</Badge> <Badge size ="sm" className="badge-d">**25cut-USDC**</Badge> <Badge size ="sm" className="badge-d">**25cut-BTC**</Badge> <Badge size ="sm" className="badge-i">**>50cut-USDC**</Badge> <Badge size ="sm" className="badge-i">**>50cut-BTC**</Badge>

In this example only BTC is available for trading - but any number of arbitrary tokens can made available for trading - added anytime while the market is active.

### ❬ Split ❭

Split is a protocol function that mints a full set of universe tokens for a deposit asset. Split function must be called whenever any asset is deposited into a market, whether it's a simple deposit or an atomic deposit + swap action, as is often the case for users.

e.g. depositing 10,000 USDC into the "US 2028 Presidential Elections" market would split it into <Badge size ="sm" className="badge-r">**10,000 RWin-USDC**</Badge> and <Badge size ="sm" className="badge-d">**10,000 DWin-USDC**</Badge>

### ❬ Merge ❭

Merge is a protocol function that burns a full set of universe tokens to withdraw the underlying spot deposit asset. This function is optional for early withdrawal, and must be called explicitly.

e.g. in the _"US 2028 Presidential Elections"_ market, a user merges <Badge size ="sm" className="badge-r">**6,500 RWin-USDC**</Badge> and <Badge size ="sm" className="badge-d">**6,500 DWin-USDC**</Badge> to withdraw 6,500 USDC from the market.



### ❬ Settlement ❭

Settlement refers to the point in time after a specific market's outcome becomes known, when lightcone pushes an onchain oracle update about it to the protocol.

Post-settlement, users can redeem winning universe tokens 1:1 for corresponding spot assets, without a deadline.

e.g. after the _"US 2024 Presidential Elections"_ market settlement, all <Badge size ="sm" className="badge-r">**TrumpWin**</Badge> universe tokens; <Badge size ="sm" className="badge-r">**TrumpWin-USDC**</Badge> <Badge size ="sm" className="badge-r">**TrumpWin-BTC**</Badge> <Badge size ="sm" className="badge-r">**TrumpWin-SOL**</Badge> etc, would have become redeemable  1:1 for spot, while all <Badge size ="sm" className="badge-d">**KamalaWin**</Badge> tokens would have ended up worthless (as in; never redeemable for the underlying).
